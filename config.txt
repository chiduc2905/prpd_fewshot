# PD Scalogram Project Configuration

# This file serves as a reference for default hyperparameters.
# Actual training/testing is controlled via command line arguments in main.py.

## Dataset Configuration
# DATASET_PATH = ./prpd_images_for_cnn/
# CLASSES = ['surface', 'corona']
# NUM_CLASSES = 2
# SPLIT = 70% train / 15% validation / 15% test

## Training Configuration
# MODEL = covamnet  # choices: covamnet, protonet, cosine
# DEVICE = cuda
# NUM_EPOCHS = 100 (1-shot) or 50 (5-shot)  # Use early stopping
# LEARNING_RATE = 0.001
# BATCH_SIZE = 1  # Episodes per batch

## Few-Shot Settings
# WAY_NUM = 2    # Number of classes per episode
# SHOT_NUM = 1   # Support samples per class (1 or 5)
# QUERY_NUM = 19 (1-shot) or 15 (5-shot)  # Query samples per class
# EPISODE_NUM_TRAIN = 1000 (1-shot) or 600 (5-shot)
# EPISODE_NUM_VAL = 600
# EPISODE_NUM_TEST = 600

## Output
# PATH_WEIGHTS = checkpoints/
# SEED = 42
